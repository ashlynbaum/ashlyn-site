[Treehugger](http://www.treehugger.nz/) won the award "Most novel use of Landcare Research data" at [Naturehack 2015](http://naturehack.confetti.events/)READMORE. Nature hack occurred of the weekend of November 7, 2015. This 24 hackathon was focused around using datasets relating to nature. Many of the datasets were provided by [Landcare Research](http://www.landcareresearch.co.nz/home).

## The Scene
The hackathon was held at a secret location, which turned out to be Zealandia. Zealandia is a beautiful nature reserve and native animal sanctuary located in Wellington, NZ. It was an amazing experience to be able to spend the weekend surrounded by so much amazing nature. 

## The challenge
To make something that is innovative, uses one of the many datasets provided, that is live, and actually works. We were provided heaps of datasets from Landcare Research. With the exception of having one of the criteria for the hackathon be using one of the datasets, we were given free reign to make what we wanted.

Obviously, the idea is the challenging part. As a team, we decided we wanted to make something interactive, an app that is more than just data visualization.

## Treehugger
The app that we ended up making is called Treehugger, check it out at [treehugger.nz](http://www.treehugger.nz). Treehugger is an app that game-ifies tree identification. You sign in and search for forests in your area. This search makes an API call to Landcare Researches data. From there you select a forest near you, and you will be presented with trees to identify. Upload a photo of you hugging the tree to unlock the tree and collect your badge. Your goal is to collect all the tree badges in the forest.

## Conclusion
Treehugger was awarded "the most novel use of Landcare Research data". The weekend was a great success, and I am so appreciative of the people of confetti and all of the sponsers of the event. I had a fantastic time working with my team Nay-Chur! I'm so happy to be able to spend my spare time 'hacking' on project that focuses on brings people's awareness back to nature, with so many uniquely awesome individuals. Stay posted as team Nay-Chur has plans on continuing development of Treehugger.
