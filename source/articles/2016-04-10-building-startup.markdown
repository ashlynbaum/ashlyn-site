Recently, I co-founded a company called [Traject](http://www.traject.nz) in Wellington, New Zealand. This is a short list of things doing of what I've learned along the way, currently (1 month in). READMORE

## 1. Create Mentor Relationships
I like to listen to interviews and read articles written by people I deem influential and successful. Something that I have heard repeated is that people have used mentors. I have had people who I would informally see as a mentor in the past, people who have offered me, taught me programming, answered my questions, and offered me life advice. But until I started working at Traject, I had no idea that a mentor relationship could be so well defined.

I originally felt like I was robbing my mentors of their time. That I should be paying them for their advice. Now I know that mentors have their own reasons for mentoring, whether it is to influence, invest, network, or to simply give back. People who are in the position to mentor, particularly in the world of business, do it because they want to. It is not a drain for them.

Second thing, ask a mentor to be your mentor. Just ask them, it's that simple. Be clear and communicative, you can say: this is what I offer you, this is what I want from our relationship, I would like to meet X times a month, for X amount of time, etc. Surprisingly, on of the mentors we landed, we just asked if he would mentor us, and his response was, "Yes I think I am one of the most qualified people in this area to mentor you."

I recognize how lucky I am that I have these mentor relationships. My mentors  see something special in my co-founder and me and are choosing to offer us their time and advice. I want to really make sure I utilize and respect their time and see it as a gift these people are given me. I put serious consideration to their advice, and I want to always be able to articulate why or why not I choose to follow, or not follow, their advice. 

## 2. Manage Advice, It will conflict
Mentors will give conflicting advice. This can be great, and difficult at the same time. Most recently, I talked with a start-up founder about company structure, running an LLC vs. Co-op, and the benefits of going co-op and getting funding with capped returns. Sticking to morals and having a social mission lead to a smaller pool of potential investors, but that small pool was filled with like-minded individuals. Later that I, I met with another mentor who's opinions were the opposite; they seemed grounded in the reality of the current and historic market.

## 3. Success is Variable
In the similar way that mentors advice and opinions can conflict. So can stake-holders opinion of success. 

>"What does success look like to you and how do you measure it?"

The advice I was given by many mentors was to always ask what success looks like in the eyes of a stakeholder. It can be surprising how each stakeholder in a project can have a different opinion on the matter.

## 4. Read More
When I ask someone for a book recommendation, I like to ask, "What book in and of itself, through the act of reading it, will give you a super-power like skill?" Personal growth and development are super important to me. I typically read books that promote thought; that cause me to think about a subject different. 

## 5. Give and Expect Honest Feedback
On the topic of personal growth, feedback is key. Giving feedback can be hard, but keeping it actionable, specific, and kind is a simple way to make it easy. Using 'Non-Violent Communication' can keep conversations focused on the action issues, instead of turning into an argument. 

I feel quite grateful that my business partner is on the same page as I am when it comes to feedback: let's have lots of it. Feedback is an integral part of the agile process.

> What went well, what didn't go well, what can be improved.

We both know that for each of us to get the most out of our experience starting a company together, we need to be able to up our game as quickly as possible. With feedback not being taboo, we can quickly on board the feedback, and make changes if necessary.

## 6. Don't be Afraid of the Trough 
The trough is the part of running a business when you feel like you are in the thick of it. When happiness levels have dropped, and stress has increased. When metaphors of boats sailing against the wind, and storms or other disastrous scenarios are used to describe how you are feeling. This lull is surprisingly normal, and the quicker you get there, means the quicker you are getting to the heart of the problem.

With Traject, 3 weeks into problem discovery, things were hard. Our stakeholder had an idea of what the solution was going to be, and it was our job to discover the problem, go deeper, and navigate what the problem actually is. We were getting many mixed messages from stakeholders, and at the time, we didn't know how we were going to solve things. It felt like shit... and amazing at the same time. It is because we were doing our jobs and diving deep into the problem that we found ourselves in that position. 

> If we stayed on the surface of the problem, we would not be able to make an impact. 

## 7. Stay Positive
Recognizing things for what they are: learning experiences. Life is one big learning experience. My work ethic is still very high, I have focus, and I have goals. But, I try to remember not to get to stressed out, because wealth comes from experience, skills, and network. If you fail, you can learn from that experience apply that knowledge to all future endeavors. 

## 8. Love Processes and Track everything
Documentation is vital. Documentation allows for easy on-boarding of future colleagues or to help track information, and help boost productivity. 

Traject was developed following [Lean](http://theleanstartup.com/) practices. Sometimes I fear that lean can be to present focused. I feel like an eye for the future might be necessary, but maybe that's all it needs to be an eye. Lean keeps you focused on discovering the problem, and iterating on how to find the one smallest thing that you can change that will have the largest impact. 

## 9. Stand for Something
Leave the world in a better place than it was when you found it. Social missions have more importance in today's business market than ever before. It will give me and my company a reason to exist, more than just making money. I dislike being just a cog in a wheel working on projects that are just a means to an end. Yes at times, I do just need to be able to put food on the table and pay rent, but at the same time, I only want to be working on something that will have positive local and global impact.

I don't need to be afraid of how I will be perceived by having morals. Studying Geosystems Engineering and Hydrogeology in university meant that I spent a lot of time studying petroleum and interacting with the fossil fuel industry. Even though I spent a fair bit of time studying petroleum engineering, I never had any desire to work in that industry. In fact, I was morally against it. I felt like, at the time, that I was the only one who had these feeling while everyone else just cared about making a good salary.

When I began working as an hydro-geological engineer, it wasn't long before I learned that a large portion of my clients did not align with my moral criteria. Which lead me to pivot my career to a path of web development, design, and entrepreneurship. I can stand up for my beliefs, promote social change, promote environmental change, and still be successful. I do not have to live in the paradigms of an old world system.

Traject's core philosophy: "To drive New Zealand's primary economic export to be knowledge driven, instead of exploitative agriculture driven."
