I enjoy listening to podcasts. There are a handful of podcasts READMOREthat I regularly listen to. This post will dive into my favorite podcasts and why you should listen to them too.

###My Favorite Podcasts in Order:
###1. [The Tim Ferris Show](http://fourhourworkweek.com/podcast/)
Tim Ferris has an amazing range of guests on his show. I find that he is a great interviewer, and asks interesting questions, because he is an interesting person. Typically conversation topics can range from, entrepreneurship, life-hacks, exercise, relationships, meditation, and even acroyoga.  
###2. [99% Invisible](http://99percentinvisible.org/)
With each episode around 20 minutes, 99% Invisible is a wildly interesting show that is quick and enjoyable to listen to. Each episode covers a story that is design related. Design principles are not spouted at you; each episode tells a story about something in history that has to do with design. 99% is also well produced. 
###3. [JavaScript Jabber](http://devchat.tv/js-jabber/)
These episodes are long; I'm not going to lie, between 1 and 2 hours each. But they cover topics relating to JavaScript and programming in general. Listening to JavaScript Jabber helps me stay up to date on all things JavaScript. My favorite part has to be the 'picks' at the end of the episode. 
###4. [Giant Robots Smashing into other Giant Robots](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/)
These episodes are a little bit easier to swallow, with an average episode length around 30 minutes. Gian Robots covers many programming topics, typically ruby related, but sometimes I'll find a good JavaScript related episode. 
###5. [Developer Tea](https://developertea.com/)
These episodes are about 10 minutes long. They cover bigger topics that apply to developers, without getting into too much detail about languages. These episodes are nice as a quick little burst of inspiration and to stay up to date with news relating to the development world.
###6. [Radiolab](http://www.radiolab.org/)
I compare Radiolab to 99% Invisible, both are story telling podcasts. Radiolab typical tells non-fiction stories that have to to with something interesting or science related, happening either now, or in the past. I like the production quality of the show.
###7. [Entrepreneur OnFire](http://www.entrepreneuronfire.com/)
Since I have always been interested in Entrepreneurial endeavors. I like listening to this show because all of the guests that are interviewed are entrepreneurs and listening to the lessons that they learned through the process.

I typically find time to listen to podcasts in the mornings, while cooking lunch or dinner, cleaning the house, or walking through the streets of Wellington. On an average week, I'll find that I listen to about 4 to 6 podcasts. 

A typical format that most podcasts have is 'picks' where the guests talk about their current favorite things. My 'pick list' of podcasts are a great resource and learning tool. Enjoy.
