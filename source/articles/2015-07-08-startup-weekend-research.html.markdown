What a whirl wind of 48 hours. I attended Wellington StartUp weekend with no idea of what would be ahead. I ended up building a viable product with a team of amazing people. Within one weekend, a viable business was formed. 

### The name: WellU

###Friday Night
The pitch was made, in a nut shell: a game to teach healthy habits to children. I joined a team of developers, designers, psychologists, and business savvy individuals.  The evening began with introductions and taking about what we wanted for the weekend. Then lead into brainstorming about the product. Everyone contributed ideas, but it seemed like forever until we finally figured out a concept that we would be comfortable taking on for the weekend. After several hours of brainstorming and discussion, around midnight I went home.

###Saturday
Saturday morning came around, and I met up with the team. After some serious consideration about validating our product, we decided children, would not the best user of our product; strictly from a validation perspective. The idea of creating a game to teach children healthy habits had to go. What we did have around us were post graduate students. Post-grads became our user. We pivoted. The rest of Saturday morning was spent brainstorming and validating. Saturday afternoon we began to build our product. 

An application to help post grads succeed, by recognizing when they are emotionally at risk. We named it: WellU. Wellness at universities, created in the city of Wellington.

###Sunday
Sunday was spent creating the presentation and preparing our pitch. After several sample pitches, getting feedback from mentors, strengthening our week spots, we presented WellU in the evening. The first big Pitch. Technical difficulties did happened, but we moved past them. I enjoyed seeing what the mentors questioned us on, and how quickly we were able to improve our final pitch because of it.

##The Problem
Post graduate students are at high risk for mental heath issues. Up to 50% of PHD students drop out of their course. This costs the universities resources, time, and money. Research about post graduate students suggested the reasons for this are related to personal motivation, isolation, and stress.

New Zealand universities receive money from the government when students complete their PHD. Having 50% of students not completing or delaying their completion is a huge pain point for the university.

##The Solution
Research points out that students who are in these environments are less likely to reach out in person, the more their emotional wellbeing declines. But they are still willing to reach out on-line. 

WellU app that allows students to report their emotional state, get direct access to resources available to help them. Administrators would be notified of the students wellbeing and would be prompted to check in on the student. 

##Itâ€™s all about the pitch
Although I went to StartUp weekend with the intension of participating in a Hack-a-thon, 48 hours of programming in one weekend. I quickly learned that much of the time at the beginning of the weekend is spent brainstorming and validating, while the second part of the weekend quickly became about preparing for the pitch. Design and architecture of the application became the selling point, not the actual application itself.

I think the key to successful start up weekends does not have to do with how much of your product you actually build, but instead is about the quality of your pitch. A good pitch will have good market validation, a validated solution, a target user and customer, and a good future business plan. 

Below is a video clip about WellU that we presented in our product pitch.
